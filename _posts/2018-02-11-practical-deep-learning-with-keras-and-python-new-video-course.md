I've just finished creating a new video course on Udemy about **Practical Deep Learning with Keras and Python**. It's aimed at two types of people:

1. Those who are just coming to machine learning and deep learning and want a soft (code-based introduction) as opposed to the mathematical treatment typically given to the subject.
2. Those who have had ML/DL before but have trouble applying the concepts in code.

For the dedicated readers of my blog, I'm making it available at the minimum price of just $9.99. Please use the following coupon link to access it at this price.
