If you've been hit by the Trojan masquerading as an avi -- "Funny UST Scandal.avi.exe", you need to read this post.

[Remove Funny UST Scandal Manually](http://upgrayded.blogspot.com/2007/11/removing-funny-ust-scandal-manually.html)

It takes just a bit of work but it's lovely. I worked for a day through Symantec and Kaspersky antivirus and couldn't get anywhere. With this manual methods, I removed the annoying thing in 10 minutes.
