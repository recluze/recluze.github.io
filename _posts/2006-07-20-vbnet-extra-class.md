As promised, I'll be giving extra lessons for VB.NET in City University for all who are interested. Please understand that these are not step-by-step tutorials. I'll be giving you guidelines only and I expect you to do most of the work. We'll take it one class at a time. Here's the details for the first class.

- Date: Monday 24 July, 2006
- Time: 12:00pm
- Duration: approximately an hour

Please leave a comment below along with your name and ID so that I have an estimate of the number of students.
