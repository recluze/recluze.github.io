Well, since no one's paying any attention to my questions regarding the use of AJAX, guess I'll have to go along with the current implementation of the technique. For that, I've found another thorough article.

[Ajax Tutorial: Ajax What Is It Good For?](http://dhtmlnirvana.com/ajax/ajax_tutorial/)

Please let me know if you find anything regarding AJAX. Tools, tutorials, discussions. But only if they're useful. I've seen lots of boring stuff around.
