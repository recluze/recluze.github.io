This is a more of a brainstorm than an idea and I have no idea if this already exists. But here's the thought anyway.

I read "Adobe Blogs" -- a single interface to all the blogs contributed by the Adobe team. Is there an equivalent of that in the twitter/microblog world? To the extent that I've seen it, there is none. Each corporation dedicates a person to write on twitter for them. How's about having a single aggregating microblog that provides a single interface to a corporation's microbloggers. Right now, you have to subscribe to all the different microbloggers or have a single person write on behalf of the whole business. Can we not distribute this so that every employee can chip in?
