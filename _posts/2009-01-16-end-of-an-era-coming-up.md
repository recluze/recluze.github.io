With Bill Gates already out of Microsoft and Steve Jobs [taking a sick leave](http://www.forbes.com/technology/2009/01/14/jobs-apple-health-technology-cx_pco_0114paidcontent.html) from Apple, I believe it's the end of an era for consumer computing. It is my opinion that Jobs is about to leave Apple for good. They just wanted to soften the blow by letting him take a small leave instead of announcing the big departure. Stocks fell even as a result of this and even a rumour of a departure may have been catastrophic. Anyway, it seems that Steve Jobs will be gone and so will the era of desktop computing. Google's often termed as the new Microsoft. The position for the new Apple is open and [Android](http://www.android.com) seems to be putting Google in _that_ position as well. Is this going to be a single super-power situation?
