For those who are interested in the activities of SERG but can't come over to the end of the world (Phase 7 in Hayatabad), here's a resource that you might benefit from. Video lectures of workshops conducted by SERG members are being uploaded online on different services. These will invariably be free and you can view them online if you have a reasonable internet connection. See the list [here](http://recluze.wordpress.com/for-students/video-lectures/).
