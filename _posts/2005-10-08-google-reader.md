Google's awake again. This time it's the RSS feed aggrigator. I've seen the famous Newsgator Online and I must say, although Newsgator probably had more features (although not apparent), the Google interface is much faster and easy to use. It's another step towards Google's online software. Looks good. It's still in the Labs though.
