My visit to Oxford was concluded with a two-day travel back. It was back-breaking (my back is still broken) because of all the walking and the sitting. The paper I presented can be seen on the [publications page](http://recluze.wordpress.com/publications/) and the photos of the trip along with captions can be seen on my [facebook album](http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=59884&l=6ab3809547&id=523073038). I am currently writing the visit report (to be submitted to the funding agency -- ICT R&D) and may upload it if it seems interesting. The personal costs for the trip were 14,000 pakistani rupees including the visa fees. Not bad for a trip to Oxford.
