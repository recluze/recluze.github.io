 **Update:** If you are interested in getting a running start to machine learning and deep learning, I have created a course that Iâ€™m offering to my dedicated readers for just $9.99. [Practical Deep Learning with Keras and Python](https://www.udemy.com/practical-deep-learning-with-keras/?couponCode=RECLYBLOG).

I gave a talk on Practical Machine Learning, which was well received. It covers the concepts from absolute scratch and covers all prerequisites. It also covers the theoretical foundations. Please go through the videos and let me know how I can improve them.

If you would like to receive updates when I post similar content, please signup below:

Part 02 wasn't recorded but you can start with 03 without it.
