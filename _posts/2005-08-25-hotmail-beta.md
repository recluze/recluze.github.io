Finally! something about Microsoft too!

The guys at Microsoft are working on a new interface for the Hotmail engine. It's called Wave 11 and the system is called - as of yet - Hotmail beta! Great codename, eh? Anyway, here're a few screenshots of the system. While you're at it, take a look at the new MSN Messenger 8 too. I hear it's for Windows Vista but can't hurt to take a look at it, right?

I believe they're using AJAX technology for Hotmail Beta. If they're not, Microsoft's just wasting her time with this new interface.
