One of the problems I always faced with linux was the installation of new software. I've been trying to get a good lisp IDE installed for more than three weeks - without any success.

The answer is 'yum'. It's a wonderful tool for installing software on linux. What's more, if you don't want to work with command line tools, do a 'yum install yumex'. Yumex works like a gem. Search for a software to install, add it to queue and process it! The interface is pretty sweet too.
