Today, we (actually, Shaz and Sanaullah) got GPS working in the Openmoko phone. We couldn't get a fix inside the lab but we got one within a minute on the roof. The values didn't seem to make sense at first but after a little thinking and tinkling, we got the map pointing towards the exact building, within feet of our actual location. A technical description of the procedure will follow soon on the group's blog (inshaallah).

We're still working on using the data inside our access decision engine. More on this (much) later.
