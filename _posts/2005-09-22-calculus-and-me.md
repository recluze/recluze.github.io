I've been working on Calculus and Analytical Geometry for about a month now. I've used lectures by Dr. Faisal Shah Khan of VU, Pakistan. I would rank him with some of the best teachers I've ever studied under. He built up the subject very nicely and has given me a thorough understanding of the matter. I just wish I had his email to send him a note of thanks.

Also, thanks to all the friends who've helped me in any way for this course. This is supposed to be a milestone in my understanding of computers and Maths. So, thanks to them for those notes and for the CDs.

I won't forget you when I become a billionaire. \*Grin\*.
