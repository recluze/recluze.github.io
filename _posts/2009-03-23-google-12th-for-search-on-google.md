That cryptic title basically means that if you search for "search" on Google, the first result you get is for live.com. Surprising but what's more so is that Google is 12th on the result list -- coming after such giants as Search.org, Altavista and Netscape. Who uses those anyway and how come Google itself is doing so great for that?

Could it be that I've somehow demoted Google using the wiki features? Can anyone confirm that they're getting the same (or similar) result?
