This post will provide a way for students of HCI (Fall 07 - FAST-NU) to keep track of their results throughout the semester. Quiz/assignment scores and exam grades will be available through the spreadsheet embedded below. It will be your responsibility to bookmark these pages and visit the pages after exams to see your official score. If you have any problems/concerns, let me know _through email_. Commenting on this post is enabled but should only be used in case you have suggestions for improvement of this system. Do not post anything about your scores. I will not answer any such queries here.
