Last time I installed Google Earth, Peshawar was only a vague shadow of a land. I installed beta of Earth 4 yesterday and located Hayatabad. The images are now copyright 2006 and are pretty vivid. I'm putting an image of Phase V here (along with a shot of my house).

I'd like to do a single image of the whole of Peshawar but my net speed is very low. If anyone can send me images of any part of peshawar, I'll be very happy to start building the jigsaw.

(Oh, and if you _do_ decide to send me images, make sure they're taken from an altitude of 7864ft and north pointing upwards!)

In the shaded portion is this:
