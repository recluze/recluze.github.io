 **Update:** If you are interested in getting a running start to machine learning and deep learning, I have created a course that Iâ€™m offering to my dedicated readers for just $9.99. [Access it here on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/practical-deep-learning-with-keras/?couponCode=RECLYBLOG). If you are only here for Matlab, continue reading =]

I had trouble getting Matlab 7 to work with Windows 7 RC even after setting the compatibility options. So, after a bit of search, here's the solution (copied from ELFEHRIJ on [http://bit.ly/Jt7ij](http://bit.ly/Jt7ij) with some minor changes).

After installing Matlab (use Classic Windows Theme if you have problems with the installer):

1. To use Matlab with other windows 7 themes you have to change Java VM used by matlab.
2. Download latest Java version and install it.
3. Go to&nbsp; \<Matlab-installation-dir\>\sys\java\jre\win32 you will find a folder named jre1.5.0\_07 (or a similar version). Rename it to Original\_\<whatever was originally there\>
4. Go to C:\Program Files\Java you will find file named jre6. Copy it to \<Matlab-installation-dir\>\sys\java\jre\win32 and rename it to \<original jre directory name\>

This will ensure that Matlab uses the new JRE instead of the old one. Just start Matlab now!

_Update_: Thanks to "ra" and larry for the corrections.
