I've finally managed to attend a class (as a student, that is). My MS classes have started today. For those who don't know (and for some obscure and unfathomable reason, still care) I've gotten myself admitted in MS programme in City University. It's a research based programme and it'll take two years. Inshaallah!

I've got a vague idea of what I'll be doing for research. Don't want to give it away right now though.
