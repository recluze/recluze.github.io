You keep saying I write nothing about non-Google stuff. Here it is then:

I've been flirting with many browsers since a long long time ago. Just couldn't find anything that could make me stick to it for more than a day or two. I've been using Opera for a long time now but just for checking my secondary mails and stuff like that because it remembers my passwords (the wand is great).

Firefox has been there for a long time and is fast becoming the sweetheart of geeks all around the world (if only because it's the only one to come near IE.

I've been using it for two days now and must say: it's actually better than IE in some ways (especially with the extensions). I've already found out ways to enhance my Google search experience and a double click dictionary system!

And of course, web page rendering's absolutely the same as IE.

I've been thinking of putting a 'Firefox' image on my blog/site.
