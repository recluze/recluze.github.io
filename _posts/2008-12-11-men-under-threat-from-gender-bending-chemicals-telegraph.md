According to [Telegraph.co.uk](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/3660141/Men-under-threat-from-gender-bending-chemicals.html):

> Scientists are warning that manmade pollutants which have escaped into the environment mimic the female sex hormone oestrogen... The authors claim that the chemicals found in food packaging, cleaning products, plastics, sewage and paint cause genital deformities, reduce sperm count and "feminise" males.

So, there you go. Stop the pollution or you'll all turn into girls.
