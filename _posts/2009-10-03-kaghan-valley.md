I recently went to Naran in Kaghan Valley of NWFP (Pakistan). The place is amazing and I'd just bought a new SLR camera. So, my friends and I shot quite a few pictures of the place. I've uploaded them in many places but this being my primary blog, I'll be putting thumbnails here along with links to the full versions. Click on the thumbnails for full versions and details.
