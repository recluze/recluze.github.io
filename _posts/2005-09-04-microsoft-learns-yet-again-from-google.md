Out of Microsoft Sandbox comes [Start.com](http://www.start.com). Take a look and tell me this isn't taken straight from Personalized Google. I mean, come _on_ guys. Do some innovation. It won't do much good simply following Google's tracks. That was what other companies were doing when Microsoft was innovating back in the 90s!
