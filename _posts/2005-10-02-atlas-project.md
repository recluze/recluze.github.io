Of course, soon we're going to need an IDE to do all things AJAX for us. Microsoft's started working on this with [Atlas Project](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/06/28/416185.aspx). I bet Dreamweaver will have some support for it in the very near future. Probably as soon as [version 8](http://www.sitepoint.com/article/dreamweaver-8-standards).

In the meantime, we're going to need to know [DHTML and Javascript](http://www.sitepoint.com/subcat/javascript) to do everything by hand. I hate hand coding Javascript!

Here's another cool tutorial on [DHTML](http://www.sitepoint.com/article/beginners-guide-dhtml) from Sitepoint. Search on webmonkey for a DHTML tutorial too. I love webmonkey's tutorial.
