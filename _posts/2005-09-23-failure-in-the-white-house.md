Looks like machines are finally starting to get more intelligent than humans. I came across this on Google's own blog. Do a search on ' [failure](http://www.google.com/search?q=failure) ' in Google and see the first result that comes up.

<!--m-->Seems like Google's search engine thinks "Biography of President George W. Bush" is the 'top result' for failure. I wonder why that is!!
