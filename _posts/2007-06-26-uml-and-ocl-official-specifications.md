I've been working on formalization of UML and OCL for some time. Of course, specifications are necessary for formalization but they're also helpful for learning the tools themselves. If you're working with UML and/or OCL, you may find these specs helpful:

[UML 2.0 Infrastructure Document v2.1.1](http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/07-02-04)   
[OCL 2.0 Sepcification](http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/2006-05-01)
