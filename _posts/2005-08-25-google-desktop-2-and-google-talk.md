I've been working on these two for the past few days and I must say that Google's softwares are only getting better! A _lot_ better.

Google Desktop is _the_ search solution for my money. (Actually, it's free. So...) It searches in real-time. Just start typing what you want to search for and you get the results _instantly_.

Google Talk is a real early beta but it still shows it's Googleness. It's totally uncluttered, fast and very easy to use. Although there aren't many features in it right now but that's only because it's a very beta-ish release.

Hope to see it upgrade quickly!

Wish Google will give me a break so I can write about some other company too.
