I started teaching at IMSciences around a month ago. Today, I got the news that I'm being kicked out, mid-semester. I'm not surprised because I knew what was going on behind my back. I'm not mad. I'm not angry. I'm not even sad. I _am_ a little bit disgusted though because in the past two years, I have given IMSciences more than 15 publications. I've written two books. I've helped bring in two projects with a combined funding of over 25 million. I've played my part in creating jobs for around twenty people. I even contributed in starting a PhD programme. After all that, they didn't even have the decency to come up with a better excuse than, "some of your students had some objections on your teaching style". That is obviously an offense which mandates termination without even a show-of-cause notice.

Pathetic, really.
