I have just finished uploading a new video course about [Hyperledger Fabric and Composer - First Practical Blockchain](https://www.udemy.com/hyperledger-fabric-composer-first-practical-blockchain/?couponCode=RECLYBLOG).

I made this course because I see many people talking about Bitcoin and blockchains but they don't really know how the tech works! It's all just a buzz word and that would hamper the true potential of the technology. So, here's a brief course that will help you understand how Crypto Currencies (such as Bitcoin) work and get you started with your first blockchain and smart contract using Hyperledger Fabric -- one of the most popular, modular frameworks for blockchains.

So, head over to the link above and get your intro in 1.5 hours.
