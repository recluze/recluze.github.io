In this video, we talk about Auto Scale feature of the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). Auto Scale allows AWS to automatically start new instances of AMIs as more and more load is put on the instance. You can define triggers (policies) that define what the low and high limits are. Whenever these limits are breached, instances can be started or stopped depending on the policies. In this video, we start from scratch and setup the Auto Scale feature.

All comments are welcome.
