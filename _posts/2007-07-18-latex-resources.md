Instead of trying to write lots of LaTeX help myself, I've decided to post links to good LaTeX resouces. [Here's one](http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/LaTeX_intro.html) which is very comprehensive. I may write crash-tutorials about specifics but there's really no need to re-invent the wheel trying to write how to make glossaries and indexes.
