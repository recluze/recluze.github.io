[Light Field Photography with a Hand-Held Plenoptic Camera](http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/lfcamera/)

That's what I read it being called but I'm not so sure about the 4th D. This is a pretty nice concept though. Very nice if you know about focus in photography. This could mean a lot of saved shots.

Those of you who know about this 'Fourier' stuff, tell me how this thing actually works.
