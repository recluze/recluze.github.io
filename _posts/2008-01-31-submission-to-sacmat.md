We've just submitted a contribution to SACMAT08. For those of you who don't know it, SACMAT is _the_ conference for access control. There are many big names in the program committee and its one of the most prestigious conferences for computer security. Regardless of acceptance (and of the fact that I'm only the third author in the paper), I'm glad of the submission. It was a really nice experience preparing a paper for that big a conference. Now, we wait for the notification.
