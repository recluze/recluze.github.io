I've finally finished writing (and publishing) my article on "CSS Layout". I've converted it into a handy PDF all pretty and formatted. Took me two days just to format it in InDesign. (I had to learn the tool while doing it!) Here are the details.

**Article Abstract**

Tables are a powerful way of creating complex page layouts. That’s why many people simply refuse to let them go. Now, CSS designs have come a long way and have the same sort of power. Let go of your tables and come see how powerful CSS has become.

The main problem I faced when I started learning CSS designs was how to get some of those DIVs floating to the right position while still keeping others in their place. HTML tables made it so easy but they have their drawbacks. I decided to redo my weblog template and write a small article in the meantime. There are a lot of CSS tutorials out there. I’m not going to go into the details of CSS. I’ll just take a design and implement it with precise values to show you just how it’s done. Having said that, be forewarned, this tutorial is not for the faint of heart.
