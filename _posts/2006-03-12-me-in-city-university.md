I'm about to finish my class in Brains Degree College. I think I'll be teaching VB.NET for the next 100 years. I've already got another one in City University. It's a BCS and MCS merged class of about 25. 

I've taught them for four hours and they already think I'm too tough on them! Let's see if they can hate me as much as my Brains class.
