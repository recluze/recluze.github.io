It took me a year but I've finally moved my stuff over to Linux. I had to. I'm supposed to be a geek.

It's like moving into a new city. You don't know where to get the groceries, how to get around. Stuff that sounds trivial where you've spent your whole life. Despite the problems, i've managed to set up shop in linux. I've got almost everything ready. Graphics editting, lisp programming, internet.

Moving away from internet explorer to firefox was easy. There are problems in linux but I think they're manageable.
