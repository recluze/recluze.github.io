I remember posting on my blogger account that I was moving to Wordpress.com. It's that time again. I've moved all the contents of this blog to my new home: [http://www.csrdu.org/nauman](http://www.csrdu.org/nauman)

I'll be cross-posting material on both sites for some time but after a little while I'll simply move away from this site to my own hosted site. So, if you are reading this in feeds or check up on the site regularly, you should bookmark the new address.
