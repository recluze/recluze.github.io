Darren Neimke has done [wonders](http://markitup.com/Posts/Post.aspx?postId=8e6876bd-7450-4d88-b68c-04a264aa76f2). Dunno why it took so long. Maybe because so much's happening on the commercial side that the Giants are not very willing to invest time in something as 'small' as blogs. Service independence with blogs is what we needed. Neimke has given it a start. Now it's upto Blogger, Wordpress, Movabletype and such to take it further.
