Take a look at this:

1. Google: A company that's been free (to use) and thought of as the darling of the computing community as a whole and who looks really good to challenge the Giant Microsoft. At least in _some_ areas. This company develops (is developing, rather) applications and systems that make people more and more reliant on Google's so-called online operating system. So much so that it's made people develop a '[history of the future](http://www.robinsloan.com/epic/)' that describes how people grew (will grow) dependant on Google's OS.

2. Microsoft: The company that's thought of as monopolistic and as "closed-source" as it gets. This company develops a software architecture (.NET; especially ASP.NET) that enables all companies to deploy their own web-based applications and sell subscriptions thus reducing Microsoft's own monopoly of operating systems. Albeit from the customer's PCs only if not from the servers.

Pretty ironical, don't you think?
