Joe Cashman's put these screenshots of [Windows Vista Build 5231](http://www.neowin.net/comments.php?id=30941&category=main). Although you can only see the interface changes from these shots, they look pretty cool. I wasn't much for the XP interface but I think I'm going to move away from the Windows 2000 interface if I get something like this on my desktop.
