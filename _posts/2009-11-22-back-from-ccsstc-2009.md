I arrived back last week after attending the 16th Conference on Computer Communications and Security (CCS09) and Fourth Annual Workshop on Scalable Trusted Computing (STC09) in Chicago, USA. The conference was really good and provided an opportunity that inspired very promising ideas. Hope to get some of them prepared for the future conferences. Take a look at my publications page for details on the paper in STC. You can also take a look at the JSR321 project (the target of this paper) [here](http://jsr321.dev.java.net).

I was also able to take my camera with me there and managed to take some shots. You can take a look at them at my flickr ['Chicago' set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/recluze/sets/72157622697904307/).
