Well, maybe Microsoft does do it. Just not that openly. Google makes sure it can attract the best of brains from computers and business. How? By telling them they won't get the one worst feared thing: boredom! For those who're up there in the high IQ range, boredom is the monster. Google doesn't just play [jokes](http://www.google.com/jobs/lunar_job.html), it also makes sure that the [corporate culture](http://www.google.com/corporate/culture.html) remains as stress free as possible. I hear Microsoft does that too. It's just that you never actually _see_ them doing it.
