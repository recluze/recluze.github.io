I'm into Illustrator now. Here's my description of my first work in vectors:

> This is my first (serious) work with vectors. This was one category of modern (digital) art I never tried. Well, not 'ny more.
> 
> I'm sorry if this piece is too cliché. I have no idea about vectors and I haven't done any tutorials. So, even if it IS cliché, it isn't.

You can see it on [deviantArt](http://www.deviantart.com/view/25267674/) or [Gfxartist](http://recluse.gfxartist.com/artworks/104302).
