[ClearType Tuner Step 1: Turn on Windows XP ClearType](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/Step1.aspx)

This is a fairly nice tool for optimizing ClearType on a Windows XP machine. It has better configurability than the Desktop Configuration tool.

You need Internet Explorer as browser to use it though. It works using an ActiveX cotrol.
