I have completed my article on CSS designing for the experienced HTML coders. I've submitted it to A List Apart. I hope to get it published there. If it doesn't I'll publish it here instead. (It won't nearly be as good but still, have to put it somewhere.)

I'll also be applying my new design on this here blog. You'll see it in a week or so, inshaallah.
