For my web developer friends, XForms technology is something that you can miss, but not for long. This is what ASP.Net's server-side forms are all about. W3C's working hard on this and it's going to be in as quickly as XHTML took over from HTML. Don't get left behind if you're planning on staying in web development. I stumbled upon a basic [intro](http://xformsinstitute.com/essentials/browse/ch02s02.php). Find out more and let me know too.
