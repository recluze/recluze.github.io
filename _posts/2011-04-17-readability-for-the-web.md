I just came across this great feature in Safari (having downloaded it for Windows 7) that's called 'Safari Reader'. It allows you to [read articles](http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-20007195-263.html) on any webpage in an extremely readable, uncluttered pane.

Having seen the great utility of this tool, I immediately searched for an equivalent for chrome. Turns out, there's an extension provided by [readability.com](http://readability.com) that does just that. Reading one of my previous posts using readability, I found it to be a great tool that enhances readability of any page; it's not only the uncluttered interface but also beautiful typography that will make reading long passages/blogs much much better.

The default pane looks pretty good. The font is modern, yet highly readable on-screen. Click the image below to see full-size snap.

You can also customize it to give a much more book-like feel. It can turn hyperlinks into footnotes, allows you to re-define the text size and the paragraph width. It also has a couple of pre-defined themes that work really well.

Pick a different theme, check the option to convert hyperlinks to footnotes and change the font-size to suit your preferences."][![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2011/04/radability1-300x173.png "Customizing Readability Pane")](http://recluze.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/radability1.png)[/caption]

There's also a wordpress plugin that allows you to let your readers view your posts in readability pane but I didn't really like that. An alternative to that is to insert custom hyperlinks using the URL shortener [rdd.me](http://rdd.me). You can read this post in readability using [this link](http://rdd.me/pyf9kgng).
