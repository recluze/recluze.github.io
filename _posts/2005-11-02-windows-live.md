[Windows Live](http://www.live.com/)  
Yes, Microsoft's reply to Google's Personalized Homepage. I didn't think I'd have to say this but Microsoft's finally beaten Google at something. (Well, ever since Google started rolling anyway.) 

The page is clutter free, fast and yet pretty. It doesn't work well with my Firefox or Flock but on IE, it's pretty good. There are some features Google guys need to "borrow" now like the search box and the simple styles which don't look crude!

Also go to ideas.live.com to see more of "Windows Live". Social bookmarks, messenger, Office. Microsoft's looking for Web2.0 dominance now. So long desktop!
