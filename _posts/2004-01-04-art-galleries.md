I really can't manage to put my artworks here on my own site. First, it's too annoying. Second, I won't get many views and comments. I publish my artworks in two galleries as of now.

Gfxartist: My username there is [recluse](http://recluse.gfxartist.com) and I've been there for ages!

deviantArt: As a deviant, I'm [recluze](http://recluze.deviantart.com). I like this site too.

Leave a comment here about any of my artworks or if you can, post comments on gfx or dA.
