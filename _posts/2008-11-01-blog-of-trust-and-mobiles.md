I came across (once again, after a long time) this blog called Blog of Trust with lots of information about Trusted Computing, Remote Attestation and mobile platforms. The author (according to the About page) is an employee of the TCG.

Two of the posts I found very interesting were:

1. "OKL4 and Android: are the pieces slotting into place?"  
Describes the possibility of an MTM on Android. This seems to be a hot topic and we need to look into it in detail and soon. Read the Post [here](http://blogoftrust.com/okl4-and-android-are-the-pieces-slotting-into-place/157).
2. "Aonix contributing PERC Ultra JVM to TECOM"  
TECOM is a project aimed at bringing trusted computing to the mobile platforms. See these two sites for the [original TECOM page](http://www.tecom-itea.org/) and a [MarketWatch article](http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/aonix-provides-perc-ultra-javatm/story.aspx?guid={CF81514E-F966-46F1-8A17-40334378B27D}&dist=hppr) on the project. Read [here](http://blogoftrust.com/aonix-contributing-perc-ultra-jvm-to-tecom/162).

I would love it if one of the fresh young associates can subscribe to the Blog of Trust RSS and keep us updated on the latest developments there. It's a very informative blog about TC.
