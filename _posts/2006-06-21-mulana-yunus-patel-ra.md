I received [this very useful link](http://yunuspatel.co.za/) through a mailing list today. Maulana sahab is a khalifa of Hakeem Muhammad Akhtar sahab (rehmatullah alaih). The site has lectures, _dua`_s and books for download. I've downloaded the english commentary on _Mathnavi Room._

One important point I'd like to mention about this site is how well it's made. It's totally functional and is very nicely designed - something a lot of sites about islam don't worry about. People putting stuff on the web about islam need to _present_ it well too.
