In my opinion, creating a cental, free, cross-platform operating system lies in the very near future of the web. (That _free_ part being optional actually but I like putting it in there.)

Take a look at these articles. Some are pretty old but they give a very nice view of the idea:

[http://www.kottke.org/04/04/google-operating-system](http://www.kottke.org/04/04/google-operating-system)

Will be putting the latest ones in as I find em.
