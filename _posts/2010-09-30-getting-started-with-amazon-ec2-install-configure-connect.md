The second in the series of Amazon Web Service tutorial videos. Here we describe how to create a keypair for shell access to an Amazon Machine Image instance, how to do basic firewall configuration to enable remote login and finally start and connect to the a basic Amazon Linux AMI.

All comments and questions would be most welcome.
