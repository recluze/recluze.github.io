If you're wondering what AI people are doing nowadays -- and you might be doing just that if you're trying to finish the final assignment I set for my AI course -- you might find this link useful. Stanford guys seem to be doing really good on the DARPA race challenge. There's also an [interview](http://scobleizer.com/2007/08/30/the-next-big-thing-from-stanford-robotic-cars/) with the designer by Robert Scoble.
