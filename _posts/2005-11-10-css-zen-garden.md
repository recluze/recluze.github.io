Take a look at [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/063/063.css&page=0) if you're still working with Dreamweaver and bloated HTML tables for designing your sites. Honestly, you need to stop. I'm surprised Dreamweaver's still using that technique for screen design. Then again, Macromedia's a business. I'd expect that from them.

Anyway, CSS design (and seperate code through XTHML, by the way) is the way to go. If you don't know anything about this stuff, I suggest you head over to [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com) and take a look at their articles. I'll be posting some of the very useful ones here at times as I come across them.

I'm also doing a redesign of my blog template and I'm planning on posting a tutorial about it. That should give you a headstart on this design with CSS thing.
