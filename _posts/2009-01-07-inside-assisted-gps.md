A nice article from arsTechnica which explains the basics of assisted GPS. Take a look:

> The Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) system can help you find yourself, or the nearest drycleaner, or a missing Christmas manger, or a hidden geocache. But our expectations of GPS are that it works accurately, instantly, and reliably on all our devices. That's asking a bit much from what is fundamentally 1990s-era technology.
