I've just finished creating the first presentation about using [ZETA](http://uebb.cs.tu-berlin.de/zeta/) for creation/analysis of Z Notation. It's a basic presentation and is not meant to be used as a reference. See a good book for Z notation (Using Z is pretty good) and the ZETA site for the tool's reference. The presentation is more about experience in learning to use these tools.

This is the first in a series of presentations hopefully leading to the complete use of Z Notation for formal verification and specification.
