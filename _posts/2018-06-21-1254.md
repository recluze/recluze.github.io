I've just finished creating an intermediate level Python course. If you have had a course on basic Python and you want to take your skills to the next level, you can take this course to learn concepts that differentiate an expert from a beginner level programmer. We will cover concepts like logging, testing, multithreading, asynchronous programming (async/await), functional programming and regular expressions.

For my blog visitors, there is a special discount and you can get this course for just $9.99. Click [here](https://www.udemy.com/beyond-basic-programming-intermediate-python/?couponCode=RECLYBLOG) to enroll.
