Zaid Hamid is cornered. He has nothing to say and nothing to clear his name with. As one of my friends put it, "there is no need to expose Zaid Hamid". He is clearly deviated but some people still don't get it. So, I thought I should help these people figure out what the question under discussion really is around here. It's not about Zaid's ideas about khilafat. It's not about how good his speeches are. It's not whether he works for the CIA or against it. It has nothing to do with any of it. The question that we are concerned with here is only of Yousuf Kazzab. If Zaid Hamid defends a kazzab, then:

1. We can't let it go. We can't forget about it because it's part of our _Imaan_ to care about such things. We cannot tolerate someone who denies the finality of the prophethood of Hazrat Muhammad (_Sallallah-o-alaih-e-wasallam_). Period.
2. It doesn't matter what other things he does. It's not relevant any more.

So, if you're a "Zaid Hamid Fan" here's a simple flow chart that can help you decide what your opinion is regarding Zaid Hamid. Clear your mind and come clean with what you think about him. Then decide what the real situation here is. (Click the image to see full size.)
