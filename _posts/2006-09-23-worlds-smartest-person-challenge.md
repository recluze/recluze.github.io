We may not be the "World's Smartest Person" but it never hurts to give the brain a little exercise. International High IQ Society is conducting an intelligence tournament at

[http://www.highiqsociety.org/wsp\_challenge.php](http://www.highiqsociety.org/wsp_challenge.php)

What's good about this test is that they've tried to minimize the impact of mathematical knowledge and cultural backgrounds. That's one aspect of IQ tests I've always found disturbing. They give too much emphasis on formal methods of logic and maths. This one doesn't though.

I always liked this society's tests. This WSP challenge is really good too. Give it a try!
