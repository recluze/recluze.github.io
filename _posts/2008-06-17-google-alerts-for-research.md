If you've been working on research papers, you must realize how difficult it is to keep track of latest papers and upcoming conferences. So, here's the solution. Use [Google Alerts](http://www.google.com/alerts) to set up alerts for yourself. Here's a screenshot of my settings. I've set up alerts for IEEE, ACM and Usenix for "remote attestation" so that whenever there appears a new paper, I'll see it. (The CFP thing also works fine. I've managed to find many conferences this way.) If you can think of any more alerts, do let me know.
