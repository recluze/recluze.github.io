I've moved once again! This time, I'm taking the show to Github Pages. In the past, I've advised students to stay away from Github Pages and just stick to Wordpress because I feel doing this whole static site generation business reduces the chances of actual posting! However, since I don't post much anyway now and mostly use the site for course redirection, I decided to give it a try. 

Let's see how it goes!
