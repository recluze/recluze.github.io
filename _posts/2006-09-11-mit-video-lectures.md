I'm always surprised when someone tells me that MIT's OCW is not free. It stands for "Open Courseware" for God sake!

Anyway, I've been studying [Linear Algebra](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Mathematics/18-06Spring-2005/CourseHome/index.htm) and [Differential Geometry](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Mathematics/18-03Spring2004/CourseHome/index.htm) from the Maths section and of course [SICP](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fswiss.csail.mit.edu%2Fclasses%2F6.001%2Fabelson-sussman-lectures%2F&ei=unoFReKzMMvIwQH-g-3IBA&sig=__Vkap_Q43zSkUHClcYV4eUAML3zs=&sig2=-AbHxH5G5GeEjpvf4czr2Q) from Computer Science.

Just recently, I found audio lectures for [Psychology](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Brain-and-Cognitive-Sciences/9-00Fall-2004/CourseHome/index.htm) and I must say, even though I had no visual, I could tell that the guy teaching was good. I didn't think an audio lecture could be so interesting.

Why do I bother with these lectures? Well, some may say I have nothing better to do. (They would be right to some extent, by the way.) Actually, I take my job seriously and If my job's going to be teaching, I'm determined to make it as good as I can. These lectures are a great way of learning how to interact with a class and to learn new ways of conveying ideas.&nbsp; I've already learned a lot from SICP and I'm learning every day from Linear Algebra and Differential Geometry.

So please, stop calling me a nut. \*sob\*
