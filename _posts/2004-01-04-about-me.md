Foremost I am a Muslim and Pakistani. And I am a student/designer and just recently, I've finished my B.Sc (Hons) in Computer Science. I was born in '83. Do the math to get my age.

I have a lot of interest in philosophy and psychology (though I'm not very good at them!). See my CV if you absolutely have to find out what I (can) do.

(By the way, I don't run an institute, so please stop mailing me about the courses I offer.)

**My Hobbies**

My hobbies are reading books, designing and programming and, since recently, trying to get my skill upto the level where I can actually do some research.
