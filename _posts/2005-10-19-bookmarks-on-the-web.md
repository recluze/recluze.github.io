I've been looking for an online application for storing my bookmarks for _ages_ and it was sitting right under my nose. [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/recluze) is just the thing I wanted. I have yet to see though, how it imports my hundreds of bookmarks already sitting in my Firefox Bookmarks folder. The import feature is down for maintenance. \*Waits\*
