I've been in Dublin City University (DCU) for two days waiting for the conference to start. Today was the first day. We had a presentation from two guys from Carnegie Mellon University. The presentation, besides being very informative, was absolutely entertaining. Anyway, these guys conduct seminars (mostly small ones of two days) and I've persuaded them to do one in Peshawar. They have estimated the cost to around $12,000 which comes around to PKR. 7,00,000 -- which isn't much for universities. I'll talk about this to concerned people when I get back to Pakistan.

I have to get back to the conference in 10 minutes, so more updates later.
