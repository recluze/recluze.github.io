I return with a minor post after another long break. This time, it's about writing better English. Now, this isn't humblebragging but I cannot be considered excellent at English writing -- at least not by native standards. English is not my first language and I haven't had much formal English education. I have, however, read a lot. Even if my English is not good, I can still point out some tips shared by experts.

Here's the first one of those shared by Amanda Patterson on Writers Write. It's a list of [45 words you can use to put emphasis](http://writerswrite.co.za/45-ways-to-avoid-using-the-word-very) on words without using the word "very". I found it refreshingly helpful.

Bear in mind though that you cannot just go ahead and use a word without looking up its usage examples. Some words might have negative connotations even though the dictionary meanings look positive. For example, if you use the word '[adequate](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adequate)' to describe someone's work, they might be offended even though the dictionary meaning is that of acceptable quality.

p.s. After writing this, I searched for the word "very" and found two instances where I had used the word myself. I replaced it with better alternatives.
