 **Update:** If you are interested in getting a running start to machine learning and deep learning, I have created a course that Iâ€™m offering to my dedicated readers for just $9.99. [Practical Deep Learning with Keras and Python](https://www.udemy.com/practical-deep-learning-with-keras/?couponCode=RECLYBLOG).

I taught an introductory Machine Learning course to BS students at FAST Peshawar in Fall 2015. The feedback was quite positive so I decided to offer another course to the MS/PhD students in the next semester. The mode of teaching was also a bit different: we tried doing the pen-tablet-augmented-multimedia-slides model. The semester is still in progress but we have the core of the basics done now.

The lectures are in Urdu so might be easier to follow for those who understand the language. I will be uploading the future videos as they come up _inshaallah_. You can see the first video below and follow the complete collection on Vimeo here: [https://vimeo.com/album/3770825](https://vimeo.com/album/3770825)
