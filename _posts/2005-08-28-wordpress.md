I was surfing and came across this really nice-looking [blog](http://blog.amygdela.net/techtalk/windows-reinstall). I just _had_ to find out how the guy had made it and guess what! It's a free software.

Written in PHP and MySQL, it's a very nice [software](http://www.wordpress.org) with the best front-end themes I've seen for blogs. It's a pity that I don't have MySQL in my hosting plan or I'd be hosting my own blog. Oh well, I'll keep this in mind and when I get my new hosting plan, I'll be porting my blogs there! Inshaallah.
