I was wondering what Google was doing with a [web accelerator](http://webaccelerator.google.com/). Sounds like they're heading into the ISP business as well. Seems like a very good idea since they're already offering ad-based services and (as many are predicting) going for the browser and operating system market, an ad-based internet service would be a very nice way to plug everything into the Google Browser.

Not just [one](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000853054453/) but [many](http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum86/534.htm) are saying it and I believe Google might just be upto it. It sounds so much like Google of today.
