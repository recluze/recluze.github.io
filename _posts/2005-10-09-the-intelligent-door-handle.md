Now that's putting technology to use! If that 'added advantages for elderly...' wasn't there, I would've said someone needs to get a life! As it is, it's a pretty neat trick.

[The Intelligent Door Handle](http://rss.slashdot.org/slashdot/eqWf?m=1056):

"Poromenos writes 'Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute have developed the intelligent door handle. It combines a camera, buzzer, RFID locks and various other systems inside the door, making keys obsolete. RFID chips for opening doors will offer 'added advantages for elderly or handicapped people, saving them the trouble of wielding keys or holding the door open in order to get inside the building.''" - Slashdot
