Microsoft's in more trouble. Google's great work with linux has finally convinced the computing giants that Linux is the only possible replacement to Microsoft's monopoly on desktop operating systems. Linux is now being [backed](http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/10/21/1224249&from=rss) by IBM, Intel, HP and others.

I believe linux _is_ the best replacement for Windows. If only the GUI was a bit stronger (and faster).
