I've been busy as a bee trying to finish the flash verion of Quaks website. It's almost finished now. The skeleton is up and only a few screens remain. It's basically just text that remains now. Even that is ready. I just don't have it with me right now. 

Anyway, if you don't know what Quarks is, head over to [www.quarksweb.com](http://www.quarksweb.com) to find out. Sorry, Uzair. I couldn't hold it in any longer. It's a wonder I've been able to keep it shut for this long.
